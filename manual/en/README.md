# Edax 4.5.5 (fixed version) — User Manual

[日本語](../ja/README.md)

Version described: **v4.5.5-nikque.23** (`Nikque/edax-reversi-AVX`). Some parts do not apply to earlier versions; those places say "since v4.5.5-nikque.N".

Edax is a program that plays Othello (Reversi). It can also analyse games, solve endgames exactly and build opening data (a *book*). This manual starts with launching the program and playing one game, and goes on step by step to growing and maintaining a book of several hundred million positions.

## Reading order

If you are new, read chapters 1, 2 and 3 in order. If you want to build a book, continue with chapters 6, 7 and 8.

## Conventions

- `Text like this` is either screen output or something you type.
- Input examples start with `>`. This is the prompt that Edax prints when it waits for input; do not type it.

  ```
  >hint 3
  ```

  This means "type `hint 3` and press Enter".
- A square is named by its column (`A` to `H`) and its row (`1` to `8`). `A1` is the top-left corner and `H8` the bottom-right one. Input is not case-sensitive.
- On the board shown on screen:
  - `*` is a black disc;
  - `O` is a white disc;
  - `-` is an empty square;
  - `.` is a square where the side to move can play.
- The examples use the name of the Windows executable (`wEdax-x86-64.exe`). On Linux and macOS, only the executable name differs (see the table in [chapter 1](01-introduction.md)).

## How reliable this manual is

- This manual was first written from the source code of v4.5.5-nikque.13 and from actual runs of the Windows version.
- Changes in later versions (v4.5.5-nikque.14 to 23) were added from their source code and from runs. New commands and settings are marked "since v4.5.5-nikque.N".
- The screen examples are real output (long ones are shortened).
- Anything that was not verified by running it is marked as such.
- Speed and memory figures are given together with the PC and the book they were measured on. **A figure measured on a small book does not predict the figure for a large one.**
