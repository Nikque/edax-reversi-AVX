# Edax 4.5.5 corrected build

[日本語](README-NIKQUE.ja.md) · [Releases](https://github.com/Nikque/edax-reversi-AVX/releases) · [18 bug fixes](RELEASE-NOTES.md)

This public fork is based on upstream `v4.5.5` (`4cde6ff588f0eade07fcba0c7f02d5cd0cacd4ee`). It publishes the modified source, rebuilt Windows, Linux, macOS x64, and Android executables, the original GPL-3.0 [license](LICENSE), and the changes described below. The upstream `master` branch remains available; `edax-4.5.5-fixes` is this fork's default branch.

## Book learning and maintenance

Use these commands at the Edax prompt with the book loaded. They start from the current board, follow existing book Links, and expand eligible Leaves. A Leaf is a candidate move without a linked child position; the commands do not enumerate arbitrary unregistered moves. They stop at the configured book depth and repeat expansion until no more eligible positions or links are added.

| Command | Selection rule | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `book deviate 2 4` | Original relative and root-score error limits; retains the original selection rule. | Continuing an existing `book deviate` workflow. |
| `book deviate2 5 5` | At most 5 points of loss on any move and 5 points in total across both players; skips Leaves at a fully solved book level. | Avoiding work on already solved Leaves. |
| `book deviate3 5 5` | Same per-move and cumulative limits, including fully solved Leaves. | Reproducing the earlier `deviate2` selection behavior. |

For `deviate2` and `deviate3`, a line with black losing 2 points and white losing 3 is eligible, as is one move losing 5; a move losing 6 or losses totaling 6 are excluded. The `todo` count is the number of eligible Leaf positions found during that pass, not a count of distinct game records. The commands write progress books with `.dev`, `.dev2`, or `.dev3` appended to the configured book filename.

`bin/config.ini` controls two independent save triggers for all three deviate commands. `book-save-interval` is the timed-save interval in minutes (`0` disables timed saves during expansion). `book-deviate-save-rounds` counts productive completed rounds: `1` keeps the original save-after-every-round behavior, `10` saves after every 10 rounds and at completion, and `0` saves only at completion apart from any timed saves. One round of original `book deviate` includes both of its expansion passes; one round of `deviate2` or `deviate3` is one expansion pass. A failed or interrupted run can lose work since the last save, especially with `0` and timed saves disabled. The default is `1` for compatibility.

### `book deviate` fix

The original `book deviate` had a pointer lifetime bug. Its first `book_expand` may call `book_add`, which can move a hash bucket's `Position` array with `realloc`. The second `position_deviate` pass previously reused the old `root` pointer and could read freed memory, potentially interrupting expansion or leaving positions missing. It now re-probes the root from the starting board after expansion. Its selection rules are unchanged; this fix does not retroactively fill gaps in an existing book.

### `book merge` and `book fix`

To combine books, load the destination book and run `book merge source.dat`, followed by `book save merged.dat` to persist the result. Merge adds positions that exist only in the source; it does not overwrite positions already in the destination. It then rebuilds Links, repairs inconsistent positions (including stale `nomove` Leaves), recomputes scores and sorts moves. The Link rebuild now precedes validation, so a newly added child does not cause a false `nomove is wrong` failure. A separate `book fix` remains available to repair the current book; it is not a prerequisite for this merge path. If the source file is missing or structurally malformed, merge is rejected and the current book is retained.

Book saving writes to a checked temporary file before replacing the destination. An interrupted or failed save leaves the previous book intact, but needs enough free space for roughly another copy of the book.

## Other corrected behavior

This release corrects 18 bugs, including the original `book deviate` pointer bug; [RELEASE-NOTES.md](RELEASE-NOTES.md) lists all 18.

| Area | Changes |
|---|---|
| Files and book operations | Binary `.edx` handling on Windows; reject unsupported save extensions before opening files; safe temporary book saves; reject malformed book records and preserve the active/startup book; run `book enhance` until expansion converges. |
| Game and clock handling | Avoid division by zero for XBoard `level 0`; apply Fischer increments after moves; bound analysis history traversal and initialize pass history. |
| PGN and GGF | Reserve enough room for dense FEN and maximal GGF fields; recognize the PGN FEN tag and round-trip its time tag; limit PGN import to 60 placements. |
| Commands and protocols | Respect parser destination sizes and short filenames; return the actual GTP `reg_genmove` result; validate GTP `time_left` colors and reset response IDs per command; format NBoard counts and seconds with matching types. |

## Build and use

The release bundle includes Edax evaluation data at `bin/data/eval.dat`, copied byte-for-byte from the [upstream v4.5.5 distribution](https://github.com/okuhara/edax-reversi-AVX/releases/tag/v4.5.5) (SHA-256 `f8b2299612d9fa4414157e70e932636e33111c2602d0c2fc382a7d90ef21b792`). It also includes the upstream initial `bin/data/book.dat` and problem files. Run an executable from `bin/` so its default `data/eval.dat` path resolves, or set `-eval-file` explicitly. Choose from these packaged binaries:

| Environment | File in `bin/` |
|---|---|
| Windows x86-64, baseline / AVX2 / AVX-512 | `wEdax-x86-64.exe` / `wEdax-x86-64-v3.exe` / `wEdax-x86-64-v4.exe` |
| Windows 32-bit x86, baseline / SSE2 | `wEdax-x86.exe` / `wEdax-x86-sse.exe` |
| Windows ARM64 | `wEdax-arm64.exe` |
| Linux x86-64, baseline / AVX2 / AVX-512 | `lEdax-x86-64` / `lEdax-x86-64-v3` / `lEdax-x86-64-v4` |
| Linux 32-bit x86 | `lEdax-x86` |
| macOS Intel x86-64 | `mEdax-x64-modern` |
| Android ARM64 / 32-bit ARMv7 | `aEdax-arm64-v8a` / `aEdax-armeabi-v7a` |

The `v3` builds require an AVX2-capable x86-64 CPU; the `v4` builds require an AVX-512-capable x86-64-v4 CPU. Use the baseline build when unsure. `config.ini` is a starting configuration; set paths, `book-save-interval`, and `book-deviate-save-rounds` for your environment. To rebuild the Windows v4 executable, run `build-win-v4.cmd` from a Visual Studio 2022 x64 Developer Command Prompt. The [release-binaries workflow](.github/workflows/release-binaries.yaml) builds the other platform variants, and `package-release.py` assembles the runtime ZIP.

The upstream 32-bit macOS `mEdax-x86` is deliberately omitted. Current Xcode SDKs lack the i386 libraries needed to link a corrected binary; including the upstream executable would leave this fork's fixes absent from that file.

The original 24 regression cases passed on the normal Windows build; the new save-cadence regression also passed. Additional checks covered 300 legal games, 549,161 flip comparisons, 96 independent exact endgame positions with one and four search threads, Cassio calls, and event queue handling. Build and package checks are described in the [validation report](https://github.com/Nikque/edax-reversi-AVX/releases/tag/v4.5.5-nikque.2).
